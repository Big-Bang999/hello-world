# Top Alternatives to Heroku

# Introduction
In the cloud services world, Heroku is one of the pioneers of Platform as a Service (PaaS). The process of building and configuring a server from scratch was challenging for developers before they arrived on the scene. In addition to shared hosting limitations, cloud technology and its deployment strategies are complicated.

Heroku's platform, however, makes building, scaling, and deploying apps simpler and faster. That is why the company became a household name in the developer community.

Heroku created the Platform as a Service (PaaS) standard for commercially sustainable cloud services. The company has accomplished a lot, helping many enterprise companies achieve their business objectives.

# Firebase

![firebase.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1666276421349/skywrs772.png align="center")
[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is a Backend cloud service platform from Google. It is designed to build and power real-time applications with features like notifications, authentication, and other front-end services. 

Firebase takes a huge burden away from developers by managing hosting, backend servers, and creating backend services without writing server-side code.

Firebase automatically configures the backend storage with a simple NoSQL database that supports automatic SSL encryption and a GUI for making manual database entries.

Firebase is an excellent tool for authentication; OAuth logic’s abstraction through its robust API makes authentication easier via Facebook, Twitter, Google, and other platforms.

The in-built Google Analytics and AdSense support save developers the hassles of adding SDKs and external libraries for tracking and advertising purposes. It also allows multiple devices running a Firebase app to sync data changes instantly.

The database platform uses JSON, which is suitable for a web or mobile application. It supports Android, iOS, and Web applications, making it an excellent choice for creating native apps and web-based admin components.

The latest version is now completely hosted on Google Cloud infrastructure and has beautiful features like cloud storage and Push notifications for Android/iOS devices.

# Fly.io

![fly_io.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1666277106056/i4JSnOC4h.png align="center")
[Fly.io](https://fly.io) is a platform for running full-stack applications and databases close to users without any DevOps.

The platform uses a virtualization technology called Firecracker to enable micro-virtual machines closer to the end users and across the globe.

Fly.io is a startup founded in 2017 that received funding from a16z, Intel Capital, etc. It offers a PaaS platform that enables users to deploy micro-virtual machines closer to the end users across multiple geographical regions and to use several frameworks/programming languages.

The primary aim of Fly.io is to enable developers to complicated self-service infrastructure. It furthermore tries to eliminate abstractions without causing any mess to the infrastructure. 

Some people go as far as to confidently say that fly.io seems like a viable inheritor of the mantle of responsibility that Heroku has left into the hands of the cloud.

## 5g Technology: Opportunities And Challenges
(a Nigerian Case Study)

**Human thinking has advanced from first-generation (1G) analogue mobile technology to digital wireless systems, the fourth generation (4G) LTE being the most recent generation.

Last few decades, there has been a rapid evolution in mobile communication resulting from the quest for a better communication system. This revolutionary advancement has given rise to boundless areas to be tapped and harnessed in mobile communication. Many functionalities have been introduced to improve quality of service (QoS) and high efficiency, including low latency and low data rate, thus creating a more specialised environment for other generation mobile technology to surface like fifth-generation 5G. 


5G technology deployment will create bountiful opportunities in a wide range of applications; however, its deployment also comes with several challenges. Thus, the purpose of this essay is to outline options in the 5G network if effectively implemented, the potential difficulties that might hinder its rollout, and the measures to mitigate them.


5G technology is an advancement from 4G mobile digital wireless technology characterised by access methodology, downlink speed, uplink speed and bandwidth. The previous generations like 2G, 3G, and 4G utilises time-division multiplexing (TDM), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) in terms of its access methodology, respectively. 5G concept segments the network into various cells; hence software will run on multiple hardware devices, creating the possibility for device-to-device communication between different slices.
 

The multiple cells in 5G give rise to a heterogeneous network, thus enhancing connectivity to remote areas because of its spectrum efficiency, connection density, virtual zero latency, mobility and user low data rate. 

Its full deployment will create boundless opportunities, supporting a wide range of applications such as smart home and manufacturing experience, drone operations, efficiency in transportation, education, government establishments including entertainment and multimedia, medical services, and improvement in the general living standard of the people due to the interfacing of domains with Internet of Things (IoT).


5G network comes with several challenges hindering its deployment, including capital intensive, security, poor civil infrastructure and regulatory framework. Others include inadequate coverage of optic fibre penetration, especially in suburban and rural areas attributed to the government's right of way (RoW) policy. Also, optical fibre cable vandalism, especially during road construction and maintenance, and inadequate power supply, as well as unavailability of 5G devices such as multi-band support of upper and lower frequency bands are some of the significant challenges.


Furthermore, cybercrime will be in the increase with its entire operation due to poor cybersecurity strategy in the country as the modern communication network will revolve around the Internet of Things (IoT) in which numerous intelligent devices will connect with a broader set of applications (Leonard et al., 2020). 

In addition to network security issues, global harmonisation of spectrum across different frequency bands from international telecommunication bodies and governments seeking to maximise revenue generation from range licensing resulting in high spectrum pricing, hence causing major roadblocks to broadband penetration in suburban and rural communities.


The first line of measures is to develop a policy that will guide spectrum allocation to major industry players; test trials should be adequately monitored by a regulatory body to ascertain security and health concerns. 
A high level of cybersecurity and appropriate regulatory standards should be developedâ€”improvement in optic fibre infrastructure to give telecom providers right of way waivers. Tax incentives to major telecom industry players as 5G development are capital intensive.


Mobile Edge Computing technology should be hosted and managed by different service providers other than existing communication providers, thus resulting in a rapid expansion of the 5G network nationwide.

The government should remove regulatory barriers on small cell technology being part of 5G to allow cost-effective implementation, including the availability of a steady power supply for seamless deployment of 5G network.


5G technology is an evolutionary step that will create revolutionary positive impacts, delivering numerous societal opportunities than any other previous mobile generation. However, its deployment has different challenges. 

Many countries have solved these problems while others are still in the process. Nigeria is among such countries that are yet to deploy this technology because of its peculiar issues highlighted. Effective policy implementation, a high level of cybersecurity, upgrading critical infrastructures, and removing regulatory barriers on small cell technology can pave the way to overcome these challenges, leading to successful deployment and operation of 5G in Nigeria.
